# Rubric - m5a3 REST API backed by PostgreSQL (capstone)

This capstone is worth **100 points**, split into an automated half and a
code-quality half. Both halves are shown so this is the complete grading
reference (60 automated + 40 code quality = 100).

## Automated checks (60 pts, scored from the tests - not by hand)

The automated 60 is proportional to the share of the suite that passes. The suite
is 16 tests, so each test is worth 3.75 points. Here is what it covers:

| Check | Tests |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /health` returns 200 and `{ status: "ok" }` | 1 |
| `GET /sightings` returns the rows from the database | 1 |
| `GET /sightings/:id` (200 found / 404 missing) | 2 |
| `POST /sightings` (201 created + persisted / 400 invalid) | 2 |
| `PATCH /sightings/:id` (200 updated / 404 missing) | 2 |
| `DELETE /sightings/:id` (204 / 404 missing) | 2 |
| `student.json` is filled in (one test per field) | 6 |
| **Automated subtotal** | **16 tests = 60 pts** |

## Code-quality rubric (40 pts, scored by the instructor from the source)

The AI proposes a score for ONLY this table; the automated half is scored
deterministically from the tests.

| Criterion | Max | Excellent (full marks) | Satisfactory (~60-80%) | Needs work (~0-40%) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| REST correctness | 12 | correct verb, URL, and status code for every operation (201 on create, 204 on delete, 404 on missing, 400 on bad input) | one or two off (e.g. 200 instead of 201) | wrong verbs/URLs or 200 for everything |
| Layering (routes vs data access) | 12 | routes only do HTTP and call the repo; no SQL in the routes; repo untouched | mostly layered, minor leak | SQL written inline in routes, or logic duplicated |
| Error / not-found handling | 8 | 404 handled cleanly via the repo's `null`/`false`; invalid input returns 400 | handled but awkward | crashes or returns wrong codes on missing/invalid |
| Query safety & code clarity | 8 | any SQL the student adds is parameterized; routes are readable, async/await used correctly, no dead code | minor issues | unparameterized SQL or messy, hard-to-follow routes |

Code-quality total: 40 points.

Notes for feedback: name the concept to revisit or ask a guiding question; never
hand over corrected code. Focus on REST correctness and the clean separation
between the HTTP layer (routes) and the data layer (the repo).
